## Pages

The pages provided describe what the user interface should be and what the user should be able do on each page.

| **Page Name**    | **Description**                                             | **User Actions**                                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HOME**         | Explains the application and provides navigation links.     | User can navigate to the ALL page or create a new note.     |
| **ALL (INDEX)**  | Lists all sticky notes in a grid or column layout.           | User can click on a note title to view it, or click a link to create a new note. |
| **NEW**          | Form to create a new sticky note.                            | User enters a title and text, then clicks the submit button to create the note. User can also cancel to return to the ALL page. |
| **SHOW**         | Displays the title and content of a specific sticky note.    | User can delete the note or update it. Deleting redirects to ALL, updating redirects to the UPDATE page. |
| **UPDATE**       | Form to update an existing sticky note.                      | User can edit the title and text, then click the update button to save changes, or click cancel to return to ALL. |


## Basic Validation Requirements
- **Note Length**: 
  - Notes cannot be longer than 250 characters. 
  - If a note exceeds this limit, the server should return an error, and the user should be redirected back to the form with the note content pre-populated.

- **Title Validation**:
  - Titles cannot contain spaces and must only include letters (a-z, A-Z) and numbers (0-9).
  - Titles cannot be longer than 50 characters.
  - If the title does not meet these criteria, the server should return an error, and the user should be redirected back to the form with the title and other submitted values pre-populated.

- **Failed Validation**:
  - If a request fails validation due to note length or title constraints, the server should:
    - Redirect the user back to the form (either for creating or updating a note).
    - Pre-populate the form fields with the submitted values (title and text) so the user can correct the input without losing their work.

# Phase 2 - Boards

## **1. Implement SQL Database**
- **Description**: Transition from using a filesystem-based storage to a SQL database for storing sticky notes, boards, and tags.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Database Setup**:
    - Implement a SQL database compatible with SQLite.
    - The database should store sticky notes, boards, and tags.

## **2. Add the Concept of Boards**
- **Description**: Introduce the concept of boards, allowing users to organize notes into different boards.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Board Association**:
    - Each note can belong to only one board.
    - A board can have one or more notes.
  - **UI Changes**:
    - Update the user interface to allow users to select a board when creating or editing a note.
    - Include a view to display all notes associated with a particular board.

## **4. Create Database Schema**
- **Description**: Define the schema for the SQLite database, including tables for notes, boards, and tags.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Schema Design**:
    - Design the database schema to support notes, boards, and tags with the necessary relationships.
  - **SQL Commands**:
    - Create the necessary `CREATE TABLE` commands compatible with SQLite.

## **Database Schema Example**

This schema can be used to start, any additional modifications or updates will be for you to design based on the requirements in each phase.
**Note** - Syntax might be different depending on the type of Database you are using, i.e. SQLite vs Postgres etc.

```sql
CREATE TABLE boards (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE notes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    board_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (board_id) REFERENCES boards(id)
);

```

### JSON Object Types Overview

- **Note Object**: Represents a sticky note, including fields such as `id`, `title`, `content`, and `board_id`.
- **Board Object**: Represents a board, including fields such as `id`, `name`, and `note_count`.

The `GET NOTE BOARD` route allows users to retrieve all notes within a specific board, making it easier to organize and manage notes by board.
### JSON Objects Overview

- **Note Object**: Represents a sticky note with the following structure:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Sample Note",
    "content": "Content of the note",
    "board_id": 1
  }
  ```

- **Board Object**: Represents a board with the following structure:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Work",
    "note_count": 5
  }
  ```

Hereâ€™s the updated phase for "Authentication and Authorization," incorporating session cookies for HTML routes and JWT for API routes:

# Phase 5 - Authentication and Authorization

## **1. User Registration and Login (Authn)**
Implement user authentication functionality, allowing users to register, log in, and change their passwords using a username and password.

- **Requirements**:
  - **User Registration**:
    - Create a registration form for new users to sign up with a username and password.
    - Store user credentials securely in the database, using hashed passwords.
  - **User Login (HTML Routes)**:
    - Implement a login form where users can authenticate with their username and password.
    - Establish user sessions using cookies for HTML routes upon successful login.
  - **User Login (API Routes)**:
    - Implement JWT-based authentication for API routes, issuing a token upon successful login.
    - Secure API routes by requiring a valid JWT for access.
  - **Change Password**:
    - Provide functionality for users to change their password after logging in.
    - Validate the current password before allowing the change.

## **2. Board Access Control (Authz)**
Restrict board-related actions (create, update, delete) to authenticated users only.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Board Permissions (HTML Routes)**:
    - Ensure only logged-in users with valid session cookies can create, update, or delete boards via HTML routes.
    - Implement authorization checks for each board-related action to verify user authentication.
  - **Board Permissions (API Routes)**:
    - Require a valid JWT for creating, updating, or deleting boards via API routes.
    - Implement JWT-based authorization checks for each board-related action.

## **3. Note Ownership and Visibility (Authz)**
Associate notes with their creator (user) and control visibility based on the note's privacy setting.
- **Requirements**:
  - **Note Ownership**:
    - When a note is created, it should be associated with the logged-in user.
    - Add a privacy setting (public or private) to each note, defaulting to private.
  - **Note Visibility (HTML Routes)**:
    - Public notes should be visible to all users via HTML routes.
    - Private notes should only be visible to the user who created them via session-based authentication.
  - **Note Visibility (API Routes)**:
    - Public notes should be accessible via API routes without authentication.
    - Private notes should require a valid JWT and should only be accessible by the note's owner.
